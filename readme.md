# Optimization (fin)
The thing about the pages in templates is that they use the same JavaScript code over and over, which takes up space after all. The same thing happens with CSS, so what we could do is make .js and .css files with their content and then link them to the pages. This not only saves space, but makes it easier/comfortable to edit the pages & make them. Also fuck Acer, delete any mentions of Acer. We also should delete all other useless files from the RiiShop source code (e.g Bootstrap JavaScript, CSS files, empty files, duplicates). and thats it thanks for listening

We should also put this source on GitHub so we won't have to wait for an another Live Share session. Makes it also easier to make edits & discuss them (although we have Discord for that)
